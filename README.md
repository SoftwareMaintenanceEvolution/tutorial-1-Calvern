# Introduction
Hi! I'm Leow Khai Vern, a student in the **Software Maintainence and Evolution** course. 
Iâ€™m eager to deepen my understanding of how software systems evolve over time and how to apply modern maintenance practices in real-world projects.  

Through this course, I hope to:
 - Learn about major categories of software maintainence and techniques associated with them
 - Assess and apply suitable techniques to maintain a software
 - Learn about strategies used to evolve a legacy software 

Overall, I aim to become a more adaptable and responsible software engineer who can contribute to both new and legacy systems with confidence.
